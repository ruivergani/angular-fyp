# AngularFyp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive comparative study on the three popular JavaScript frameworks/libraries: React.js, Vue.js, and Angular, focusing on their suitability and performance in Single-Page Application (SPA) development. Alongside the study, the project also involves the development of algorithms for evaluating these frameworks based on various criteria.
___

## üíª Objectives 

The primary objectives of this project are:

- To compare the key features, strengths, and weaknesses of React.js, Vue.js, and Angular.
- To assess the performance metrics such as speed, memory usage, and rendering capabilities of each framework.
- To develop algorithms that can objectively evaluate the suitability of each framework for different types of SPA projects.
- To provide insights and recommendations for developers and organizations in selecting the appropriate framework for their projects.
___

## üíª Methodology

The primary objectives of this project are:

- Literature Review: Conduct an extensive review of existing literature, articles, and documentation on React.js, Vue.js, and Angular to understand their core concepts, features, and performance characteristics.

- Framework Comparison: Compare the features, syntax, ecosystem, learning curve, community support, and other relevant aspects of React.js, Vue.js, and Angular.

- Performance Evaluation: Design and implement experiments to measure the performance metrics of each framework, including speed, memory consumption, and rendering efficiency.

- Algorithm Development: Develop algorithms that take into account project requirements, scalability, performance, and other factors to objectively evaluate the suitability of each framework.

- Implementation: Implement the algorithms in a practical setting by applying them to real-world SPA development scenarios.

- Analysis and Recommendations: Analyze the results of the comparative study and algorithm evaluations to provide recommendations for selecting the most appropriate framework for specific project requirements.

## üõ† Technologies

The following technologies were employed in the creation of this project:

- Angular: A platform and framework for building client-side web applications using HTML and TypeScript.

- TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript and adds static typing and other features.

- HTML: Used for structuring the web pages and JSX (JavaScript XML) within React components.
  
- CSS (or CSS-in-JS): Stylesheets or CSS-in-JS solutions for styling React components and layout.
  
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for building server-side and networking applications. Often used for tooling and server-side rendering with React.
  
- npm or Yarn: Package managers for managing dependencies and scripts in the project.
  
- Jest or React Testing Library: Testing frameworks for unit and integration testing of React components and applications.
  
- Git: Version control system for tracking changes in the project codebase and collaborating with other developers.
  
- GitHub: A platform for hosting Git repositories and facilitating collaboration among developers.
  

These technologies collectively form the core toolset for developing modern web applications using React.js.
